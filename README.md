## Summary
Top Trumps is a digital hommage to the classic British card game Top Trumps from the. I made this game as a project that is part of the Ironhack Full-Stack
Web Developer bootcamp. It is a simple card game created using web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

## How to play
 Select the deck of cards you would like to play, then press start. For each card you must choose a category where you think the value will be greater than your opponents. After choosing, the losers card is put in the winners' hand, the player who obtains all the cards wins.

* Add more cards
* Text spacing
* Code readability
